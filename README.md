# Abstruct
&emsp;&emsp;Our project is based on Android Studio. It is an app themed on Beijing parks.The purpose of our development is to make it easy for Beijing citizens to visit the parks in their leisure time. We not only provide users with park data, but also design services such as navigation and forums. Our project features different travel options according to the four seasons and a change in the theme colour of the app. It can better provide users with convenient travelling services.

## 1.3 Theme Colours
&emsp;&emsp;We used the following colour palette to design the overall UI interface. We designed different theme colours according to the characteristics of different seasons as follows, for example, in spring we chose the vibrant green :sunny: , in summer we chose the delicious watermelon as the theme colour :yum: , in autumn we chose the gloomy brownish-yellow :maple_leaf: , and in winter we chose the snow-white and dark blue :snowflake: .

## 1.4 Logo & IP
&emsp;&emsp;When designing the logo, we chose the shape of a small foot. This corresponds exactly to our functional area: travelling. We also designed the logo in different seasonal theme colours.  
&emsp;&emsp;For the IP design, we chose the orange fat cat which often appears in the park, making our interface more lively and cute! It can also better fit our product theme.

## 2.2 Functional Realisation
- Implementation of all page jumps
- More difficult interface animation: after scrolling down, a hoverball button appears, and you can jump by clicking on it
- Use Baidu Map API to achieve location acquisition and positioning function
- Determine whether to register or not and jump to the interface accordingly
- By accessing the Beijing Parks database, the corresponding content is filled into the interface.
